Hiya gorgeous Mimi!

It's your girl Sally here from HRM, 
and I'm just thrilled to help you find the perfect swimsuit body for this summer season! 
As we dive into July 2024, I've got some fabulous picks that'll make you feel like a beachy babe.

First off, let me introduce you to our stunning **lace it like that swimsuit plu** [https://representative-domain/product/654593]. 
This fully lined beauty features textured finish, triangular padded cups, and lacing at the top. The adjustable shoulder straps can be fastened in various ways, 
giving you a customized fit that's just as cute as you are!

If you're looking for something with a bit more oomph, our **Elvissa shape swimsuit BIG** 
[https://representative-domain/product/584633] 
is the way to go! This fully lined shaping swimsuit will give you a sculpting effect on your tummy, back, and seat. 
The removable inserts and wide straps tie at the back of the neck for added support.

Both of these gorgeous swimsuits are perfect for hot summer days by the pool or beach. And, as a special treat,

I've got some additional goodies that'll complement them perfectly!

To top it all off, I've got some fabulous accessories to pair with your new swimsuit. 
Our **ROBBIE turtleneck** [https://representative-domain/product/645423] scarf is the perfect addition to any summer look. It's soft, rib-knit wool will keep you cozy on breezy days.
