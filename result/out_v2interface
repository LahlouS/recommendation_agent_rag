**Subject: Your Summer Essentials, Mimi!**

Dear Mimi,

Hope this email finds you basking in the sunshine and enjoying the warmth of July 2024! As your personal assistant at HRM, I've got just the thing to make your summer even more fabulous.

I noticed you're on the hunt for a cute body swimsuit. Well, darling, we've got not one, but TWO stunning options that'll make you feel like a beach goddess!

**First up: Elvissa shape swimsuit BIG**
This fully lined shaping swimsuit is a game-changer! With its sculpting effect on the tummy, back, and seat, you'll be looking and feeling your absolute best. The triangular cups with removable inserts and wide straps that tie at the back of the neck are just the icing on the cake.

Our Lined, underwired bikini top is a summer essential! With adjustable shoulder straps and padded cups that shape the bust and provide good support, you'll be confident and carefree. Plus, the adjustable metal fastener at the back ensures a secure fit.
